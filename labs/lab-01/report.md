 1: Finding the missing information they have.<br />
 2: Use easily relatable example or analogy to state the point.
3. The incident in the chapter taught us a lession about Jesse with copyright and open source technilogy conflict. Jesse Jordan of Oceanside, New York, enrolled as a freshman at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York, in the fall of 2002. His RPI major was information technology. Despite the fact that he is not a programmer, Jesse decided to experiment with search engine technology that was available on the RPI network in October. Jesse's search engine's designed to make use of 
envision and then construct a generation for the network age. But his project catched a lawsuit with RIAA which nearly forfeited his life carrer with millions of dollar fine in court demanded. The path of open source software is a field involved with many uncertity in term of law and regulation. We must understand the issue and restrictions when we handle open source software. The potential risk we don't consider at the beginning can be a huge disaster in the long run of a project.

8. Reflection
 I'm thinking about doing a project use computer vision or use puzzle solving mini game project with GUI. The CAD tool must offer some way to display the design on the user's screen. The user is designing a physical object with 3 dimensions, but the computer screen has only 2 dimensions. The CAD tool must model how we perceive objects, and draw them to the screen in a way that the user can understand all 3 dimensions of the object. We would rather not communicate directly with graphics drivers, so we can use a cross-platform abstraction layer like OpenGL, and a library called GLUT to manage our window.
